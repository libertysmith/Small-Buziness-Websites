  "about.body": "Lumi Web exists to make business and technology feel simple. I build clear, mobile-friendly websites for restaurants, cafés, and shops, with bilingual options when you need them. Many of my clients are starting a business for the first time or prefer to work in Korean. That is welcome here. I bring five years in technology and a background as a corporate analyst at a major multinational retailer. That experience taught me how to listen, define goals, and deliver on time with no surprises. My process is straightforward: we set a goal, choose the pages, collect your photos and hours, then I build and publish. Pricing is flat, communication is direct, and support is friendly. If you want a website that customers can find, understand, and trust, without the jargon, I am ready to help.",
